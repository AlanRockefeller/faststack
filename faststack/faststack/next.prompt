In the image editor, the whites slider should be reversed- moving it to the left makes the image brighter when it should make it darker.   The user should be able to double click on a slider to move it to 0, and also the users should be able to manually enter numbers to move the sliders.  Save Edited Image should be Save and Close Editor and Close Editor should be Close Without Saving.   Saving an image in the image editor should not bring up a dialog box - instead it should display a breif message in the status bar.  In the edits menu the order of the Whites and Shadows sliders should be flipped, so Shadows is next to blacks.  Brightness should be moved up under Exposure.   Add a Texture slider under Sharpness that does something similar to what the Texture slider does in Photoshop.   In the White Balance sliders, spell out the colors instead of abbreviating them with a letter.   When in the editor pressing E should close it, but currently doesn't.    S should close and (S)ave.   After pressing I to bring up the EXIF information, pressing I again should close the EXIF information pane.   Add a new flag that is like edited, but is called restacked - it should display in the same way.  If the user selects Stack Source Raws from the actions menu and Helicon successfully opens, this flag should be set on an image.   Deleting a batch of 78 images skips me forward 78 images - it should keep me on the same image.
