In the image editor, the user should be able to double click on a slider to move it to 0, and also the users should be able to manually enter numbers to move the sliders.   In the edits menu the order of the Whites and Shadows sliders should be flipped, so Shadows is next to blacks.   When in the editor pressing E should close it, but currently doesn't.    S should close and (S)ave - it currently says control-s, but control-s does nothing, and it should be just S.    Add a new flag that is like edited, but is called restacked - it should display in the same way.  If the user selects Stack Source Raws from the actions menu and Helicon successfully opens, this flag should be set on an image.   Deleting a batch of 78 images skips me forward 78 images - it should keep me on the same image.
