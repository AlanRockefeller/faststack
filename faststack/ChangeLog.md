# ChangeLog

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-03

### Fixed
-   Resolved an issue where the prefetch range was not being applied correctly after changing the prefetch radius in settings.
-   Corrected `decode_jpeg_thumb_rgb` to ensure that thumbnails generated by PyTurboJPEG do not exceed the `max_dim` by falling back to Pillow resizing when necessary.
-   Addressed excessive metadata queries during application startup by deferring UI synchronization until after images are loaded.
-   Fixed a bug where the zoom state callback was not firing, leading to low-resolution images being served when zoomed in.
-   Resolved a QML error "Cannot assign to non-existent property 'scaleTransform'" by correctly placing the scale change handlers within the `Scale` transform.
-   Handled the empty image files case in preloading to prevent unnecessary processing and correctly update the UI.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
-   Load full-resolution images when zooming in for maximum detail.
-   Call Helicon Focus for each defined stack when multiple stacks are present.

### Changed
-   The filesystem watcher is now less sensitive to spurious modification events, reducing unnecessary refreshes.
-   The preloading process now shares the same thread pool as the prefetcher for better resource utilization.
-   Stacks are now cleared automatically after being sent to Helicon Focus.

### Fixed
-   Corrected a `ValueError` in `PyTurboJPEG` caused by unsupported scaling factors.
-   Resolved an `AttributeError` in the JPEG scaling factor calculation.
-   Fixed an issue where panning the image was not working correctly.
-   Addressed a bug where panning speed was incorrect at high zoom levels.
-   Ensured that stale prefetcher futures are cancelled when the display size changes.

### Performance
-   Improved image decoding performance by using `PyTurboJPEG` for resized decoding.
-   Tuned the number of prefetcher thread pool workers based on system CPU cores.
-   Replaced synchronous file reads with memory-mapped I/O for faster image loading.
-   Optimized image resizing by using `BILINEAR` resampling for large downscales.
-   Debounced display size change notifications to reduce redundant UI updates.

## Version 0.4

### Todo

Make it use the full res image when zooming in
When multiple stacks are selected, call Helicon multiple times
After Helicon is called, clear the stacks
Fix S key - I guess it should remove an image from the stack?   Clarify what it does now.

### New Features
- **Two-tier caching system:** Implemented a two-tier caching system to prefetch display-sized images, significantly improving performance and reducing GPU memory usage.
- **"Preload All Images" feature:** Added a new menu option under "Actions" to preload all images in the current directory into the cache, ensuring quick access even for unviewed images.
- **Progress bar for preloading:** Introduced a visual progress bar in the footer to display the status of the "Preload All Images" operation.

### Changes
- **Theming improvements:** Adjusted the Material theme to ensure the menubar background is black in dark mode, providing a more consistent user experience.
- **Window behavior:** Changed the application window to a borderless fullscreen mode, allowing for normal Alt-Tab behavior and better integration with the operating system.

## Version 0.3

### New Features
- Implemented a "Settings" dialog with the following configurable options:
  - Helicon Focus executable path (with validation).
  - Image cache size (in GB).
  - Image prefetch radius.
  - Application theme (Dark/Light).
  - Default image directory.

## Version 0.2

### New Features
- Added an "Actions" menu with the following options:
  - "Run Stacks": Launch Helicon Focus with selected files or all stacks.
  - "Clear Stacks": Clear all defined stacks.
  - "Show Stacks": Display a dialog with information about the defined stacks.
- Pressing the 'S' key now adds or removes a RAW file from the selection for processing.
- Implemented tracking for stacked images:
  - `EntryMetadata` now includes `stacked` (boolean) and `stacked_date` (string) fields.
  - `launch_helicon` records stacking status and date upon successful launch.
  - The footer in `Main.qml` displays "Stacked: [date]" for previously stacked images.

### Changes
- Pressing the 'Enter' key will now launch Helicon Focus with the selected RAW files. If no files are selected, it will launch with all defined stacks.
- Refactored the theme toggling logic in `Main.qml` to use a boolean `isDarkTheme` property for more robustness.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where both the main "Enter" key and the numeric keypad "Enter" key were not consistently recognized.
- The "Show Stacks" and "Key Bindings" dialogs now correctly follow the application's theme (light/dark mode).
- Fixed a bug that caused the "Show Stacks" dialog to be blank.
- Resolved a `NameError` caused by using `Optional` without importing it.
- Corrected an import error for `EntryMetadata` in the tests.
- Updated a test to assert the correct default version number.
- Fixed a `TypeError` in tests caused by a missing `stack_id` field in the `EntryMetadata` model.
- Resolved a QML issue where `anchors.fill` conflicted with manual positioning, preventing panning and zooming.
- Corrected the `launch_helicon` method to only clear the `selected_raws` set if Helicon Focus is launched successfully.
- Resolved `TypeError` and `Invalid property assignment` errors in QML related to settings dialog initialization and property bindings.
- Fixed QML warnings related to invalid anchor usage in `Main.qml`.
- Fixed missing minimize, maximize, and close buttons by correctly configuring the custom title bar.
- Resolved QML warnings about `mouse` parameter not being declared in `MouseArea` signal handlers.
