# FastStack

# Version 1.5 - January 1, 2026
# By Alan Rockefeller

Ultra-fast, caching JPG viewer designed for culling and selecting RAW or JPG files for focus stacking and website upload.

This tool is optimized for speed, using `libjpeg-turbo` for decoding, aggressive prefetching, and byte-aware LRU caches to provide a fluid experience when reviewing thousands of images.

## Features

- **Crop:** Added the ability to crop and rotate images via the cr(O)p hotkey (or right mouse click).   It can be a freeform crop, or constrained to several popular aspect ratios.
- **Zoom & Pan:** Smooth zooming and panning.
- **Stack Selection:** Group images into stacks (`[`, `]`) and select them for processing (`S`).
- **Helicon Focus Integration:** Launch Helicon Focus with your selected RAW files with a single keypress (`Enter`).
- **Instant Navigation:** Sub-10ms next/previous image switching, high performance decoding via `PyTurboJPEG`.
- **Image Editor:** Built-in editor with exposure, contrast, white balance, sharpness, and more (E key)
- **Quick Auto White Balance:** Press A to apply auto white balance and save automatically with undo support (Ctrl+Z).   For better white balance, load the raw into Photoshop with the P key.- **Photoshop Integration:** Edit current image in Photoshop (P key) - always uses RAW files when available.
- **Clipboard Support:** Copy image path to clipboard (Ctrl+C)
- **Image Filtering:** Filter images by filename
- **Drag & Drop:** Drag images to external applications.   Press { and } to batch files to drag & drop multiple images.
- **Theme Support:** Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Delete & Undo:** Move images to recycle bin (Delete/Backspace) with undo support (Ctrl+Z)
- **Has Memory:** Starts where you left off, tells you which images have been edited, stacked and uploaded.
- **RAW Pairing:** Automatically maps JPGs to their corresponding RAW files (`.CR3`, `.ARW`, `.NEF`, etc.).
- **Configurable:** Adjust cache sizes, prefetch behavior, and Helicon Focus / Photoshop paths via a settings dialog and a persistent `.ini` file.
- **Accurate Colors:** Uses monitor ICC profile to display colors correctly.
- **RGB Histogram:** Pressing H brings up a RGB histogram which is designed to show even a little bit of highlight clipping and updates as you zoom in.
